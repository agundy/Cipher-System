Cipher-System
=============
This is an exploration of basic encryption techniques using Python.

Goals:
- Started with a Caesars addition shift cipher
- Add a Decryption mode for shifts
- Add a multiply Caesar shift encryption and decryption
-Combine multiply and addition shifts *
- Add error checking *
- Add abilitiy to handle caps and spaces 

** is in progress

Status:
Currently has a basic Caesar shift encryption and decryption mode as well as a Caesar Multiple encryption and decryption key mode. Can only decrypt a message in standard Caesar cipher currently.
